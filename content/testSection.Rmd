```{r setup, echo = F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F)
```

# Let's put a plot here

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(kableExtra)

ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) + geom_point()
```

I want to show some code here

```{r echo = T}
cars %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()
```

# And some more text

Cool!
