# Welcome!

My name is Scott Saunders and I am currently a postdoc with [Rob Phillips](https://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/) at Caltech. I get excited about bacterial genetics and massively parallel reporter assays. More info coming soon!

I recently finished my PhD with [Dianne Newman](http://dknweb.caltech.edu/Newman_Lab.html). My thesis project aimed to understand how the bacterium *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* overcomes oxygen limitation with endogenous molecules called phenazines. We know that these phenazines help support these bacteria, but we don't really know how the cells are able to execute this strategy. My work tries to understand how phenazines support electron transfer in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* biofilms, which is how these cells live in the environment and in pathogenic contexts.  

Don't hesitate to contact me about research, grad school, the computational notebooks or whatever else comes up!
